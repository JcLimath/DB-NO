# DB-NO
This is the official code for DB-NO.
We use dual-branch framework to further improve the generalization of neural operators. In general, this work is an exploration of semi-supervised learning in the field of neural operators. 
In particular, due to the lack of confidence for filtering pseudo-labels, this paper proposes a re-weighting method to filter out misinformation in pseudo-solutions.
We are grateful to Subramanian S. [1] , their open source code has given us a lot of support.
